**Fake Product Review Detection using KNN and Random Forest**

This repository contains code for detecting fake product reviews using two popular machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest. Fake reviews can be detrimental to consumers who rely on them to make purchasing decisions, and thus, it's important to develop robust methods to identify them. 

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled reviews, where each review is labeled as either fake or genuine. The dataset is divided into two subsets: a training set for model training and a test set for evaluating model performance.

### Methodology

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
Before training the models, the raw text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as:
- Tokenization: Breaking down the text into individual words or tokens.
- Removing Stopwords: Commonly occurring words that typically do not carry much meaning, such as "and", "the", etc.
- Text Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical vectors, which can be used as input to machine learning algorithms.

#### 2. Feature Extraction
In this step, we extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data. Commonly used features include:
- Bag of Words (BoW): Represents the occurrence of words within the text.
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Weighs the importance of words based on their frequency in the document and across the dataset.

#### 3. Model Training
We train two machine learning models:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple and effective algorithm for classification tasks. It classifies instances based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors.
- Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

#### 4. Model Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the models are able to classify fake and genuine reviews.

### Results
The results of the model evaluation are presented along with visualizations to aid in understanding the performance of each algorithm. Additionally, we compare the performance of KNN and Random Forest to determine which algorithm performs better for this task.
